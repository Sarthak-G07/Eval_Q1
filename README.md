# Eval_Q1

Question 1: Create a program (C/C++) that reads a matrix of integers from the user, calculates the
determinant of the matrix, and prints the result. Ensure that the program handles matrices of varying sizes
(e.g., 2x2, 3x3, etc.). Initialize a new Git repository for this project, commit the code, and upload it to your
GitHub account. Provide the URL of the repository.<br>
â€¢ Expected Output: A GitHub repository URL containing the C program for calculating the
determinant of a matrix, including handling different matrix sizes.
